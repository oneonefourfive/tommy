        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <P class="man">Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each,
             opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball 
            through the defender's hoop 
            It is a competition game, so the world made a association of it, called <br>"National Basketball Association."
